**Pubmed Miner** _Mine PubMed for publication at the Central Diagnostics Laboratory of the Division Laboratories, Pharmacy and Biomedical genetics at the University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands._

With `pubmed_miner.py` you can retrieve PubMed publications for a list of authors (and their aliases) and departments from UMC Utrecht. It then analyzes the publication data and saves the results to a Word document and an Excel file, and also produces a few graphs on the fly.


## How to install

To install follow these instructions. First, clone the repository to a directory of your choice:

```
cd to_directory_of_choice
git clone 

```

Next, create a new conda environment:

```
mamba create --name pubmedminer python=3.9
```

Activate the environment:

```
conda activate pubmedminer
```

Install the required packages:

```
mamba install biopython python-docx matplotlib numpy pandas
```

And some `pip` packages:

- `xlsxwriter` needed by `pandas` for writing Excel files.
- `openpyxl` needed by `pandas` for reading Excel files.
- `seaborn` for plotting the author collaborations.
- `networkx` for plotting the author collaborations.
- `holoviews` for plotting the author collaborations.
- `plotly` for interactive plotting the author collaborations.

```
pip install xlsxwriter openpyxl seaborn networkx holoviews plotly
```

## How to use

### PubMed Miner

The `pubmed_miner.py` is really easy to use. You can run it from the command line. For example:

```
python pubmed_miner.py --email your_mail@whatever.com --verbose --year 2023-2024 --names "last_name IN"
```

Some arguments are required and some are optional. You can see the help message by running:

```
python pubmed_miner.py --help
```

```
Required arguments:
    
    -e, --email <email-address>  Email address for PubMed API access.

Optional arguments:
    -n, --names <names>          List of author names to search for. 
                                    Default: `{DEFAULT_NAMES}` with these aliases: `{ALIAS_MAPPING}`.
    -d, --departments <depts>    List of departments to search for. Default: `{DEFAULT_DEPARTMENTS}`.
    --ignore-departments         Ignore departments in the PubMed query.
    -org, --organization <org>   Organization name for filtering results. Default: `{DEFAULT_ORGANIZATION}`.
    -y, --year <year>            Filter publications by year or year range (e.g., 2024 or 2017-2024).
    -o, --output-file <file>     Output base name for the Word and Excel files. Default: date_CDL_UMCU_Publications.
    -r, --results-dir <dir>      Directory to save results. Default: results.
    --dummy                      Dummy argument for testing. Creates a dummy dataset.
    -v, --verbose                Enable verbose output.
    -d, --debug                  Enable debug output.
    -V, --version                Show program's version number and exit.

Example #1 -- produces results for all authors in the DEFAULT_NAMES list across all departments and all years
    python pubmed_miner.py --email

Example #2 -- produces results for all authors in the DEFAULT_NAMES list across all departments for the year 2023
    python pubmed_miner.py --email --year 2023

Example #3 -- produces results for all authors in the DEFAULT_NAMES list across all departments for the years 2023-2024
    python pubmed_miner.py --email --year 2023-2024

Example #4 -- produces results for a given author from a given department for the year 2023
    python pubmed_miner.py --email --year 2023 --names "last_name IN" --departments "Department Name"
    
```

### Compare results with NBIB download

The `nbib_compare.py` script can be used to compare the results of the `pubmed_miner.py` script with the results of a download from the National Biotechnology Information Center (NBIB). This script requires the path to the NBIB download file and the path to the Excel file generated by the `pubmed_miner.py` script. It will compare the results and display the differences in the console.

First, you need to download the publication data from NBIB. You can do this by going to the [PubMed website](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and searching for the publications you want to download. Then, click on the "Send to" button and select "Citation Manager" as the destination, select 'All results', next click 'Create file'. You can then download the file in NBIB format (`.nbib`).

Now you can run the `nbib_compare.py` script:

```
python nbib_compare.py --nbib-file path/to/nbib_file.nbib --pubmed-file path/to/pubmed_file.xlsx
```

It will produce a summary of the differences between the two files. One Excel includes the differences in the publication data, and another Excel file includes the differences in the author data (taken from the `.nbib` file). The output files (`.xlsx`) will contain the unmatched PMIDs from the Excel file including the following metadata:
- PubMed ID
- Title
- Journal
- JID
- Year
- DOI Link
- Citation
- Publication Type

Some arguments are required and some are optional. You can see the help message by running:

```
python nbib_compare.py --help
```

```
Required arguments:
    --input-nbib       Path to the input NBIB file.
    --input-excel      Path to the input Excel file (e.g., results from pubmed_miner.py).

Optional arguments:
    --output-file      Path to the output file. Defaults to the input Excel basename with '_unmatched_nbib_pmids.xlsx'.
    -v, --verbose      Enable verbose output.
    -d, --debug        Enable debug output.
    -V, --version      Show the version information.

Example:
    python compare_results.py --nbib-file path/to/nbib_file.nbib --pubmed-file path/to/pubmed_file.xlsx
```

### Article Meta Viewer 

If you want to get meta data for a particular article, you can use the `article_meta.py` script to do this. This script requires a PubMed ID and an email address to access the PubMed API. It will fetch metadata for the specified article and display it in the console.

```
python article_meta.py --email your_mail@whatever.com --pubmedid 38698167 --verbose
```

Some arguments are required and some are optional. You can see the help message by running:

```
python article_meta.py --help
```

```
Required arguments:
    -e, --email <email-address>          Email address for PubMed API access.
    -p, --pubmedid PUBMEDID    PubMed ID of the article to fetch metadata for.

Optional arguments:
    -v, --verbose              Enable verbose output.
    -V, --version              Show program's version number and exit.

Example:
    python article_meta.py --email <email-address> --pubmedid 38698167 --verbose
```
